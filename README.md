Chest randomizer for alttp



 Zelda 3: A link to the past randomizer 10/02/2015
 
 Modifies a patch for a very basic hack (Replacing items in chests with flutes 
 other junk) and pseudo-randomly generates chest contents.

 Author: Smobo

 The goal of this is to have a fun category for racing like other randomizers.
 The pseudo randomness of the chest placements is done to allow the game to 
 be completed with only the Death Mountain Acsent and Decent glitchs. Both
 of which are simple to learn. Other more adcanced clips and tactics will
 no doubt be very useful, but aren't required. 
 
 A few ways I was thinking of this to be played:
 
  

 Modifications to the game ( besides random chests ):

 1. Removed Power gloves and replaced then with a 2nd pair of Titan's mitts.
   
    Power gloves over ride titan's mitts. That can make the game unbeatable,
    which is a state I'm trying to avoid with this. 

 2. Removed Red Eyegores from Eastern ( Replaced with Greenies )

   Bootless clips are too difficult to be something I wanted to be required
   to complete the game. I also figured forcing the bow to drop early would
   be bad for the flavour of the category. I don't think the game is much 
   lesser by making those two rooms slightly easier, especially since you'll
   likely lack the bow for armos anyways.


3. Purpled the magic meter
 
 	This allows people who are watching the stream know easily that a randomizer
   is being played, similar to the red tunic used in Majora's Mask randomizer.
